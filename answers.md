1. In Jest, what are the differences between describe() and it() globals, and what are good uses for them?
    In Jest describe() is used to create a block for several tests in a category that is similar and it() can be nested in the describe() function and are used for individual tests. They are used to describe the tests being executed so when they run we can see a description of each test.

2. What is the point of Test Driven Development? What do you think about this approach?
    Using TDD the test is written before the code and it will fail, then the minimum amount of code is written to get the test to pass, then test is run and should pass and the process is repeated until all of the code is written.  I think this approach could work for a developer that is experienced and has a good grasp of testing. For a new developer that is just trying to figure things out, it seems way more confusing. 

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
    1. Unit tests
    2. Snapshot tests
    3. Integration tests
